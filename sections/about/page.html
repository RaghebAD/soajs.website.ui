                <p>

                    We have chosen the beaver as our representative because of its smart and powerful building technique. It is able to build a robust structure by securing its foundation; starting from the bottom layer, and working its way upward.

                    Like the beaver, SOAJS allows you to build, from day one, a very solid enterprise level service oriented architecture that is reliable and scalable. Nothing would be an after thought. You never need to re-write your code if you want to grow your services.</p>
