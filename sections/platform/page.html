                <p>SOAJS is built by engineers, for engineers in a tactical way to guarantee rapid execution at all
                    stages of development, management, deployment and administration.

                    SOAJS offers a complete, out of the box solution to facilitate building and scaling a horizontal and
                    coherently integrated product infrastructure (aPaaS). Subsets or partial solutions are available as
                    enterprise or open source products. Combining and integrating them into a unified solution like
                    SOAJS will take months to build and at great cost

                    Adopt SOAJS as a secure and reliable foundation for the future: simplify the IT envir</p>

                        <p>SOAJS empowers engineers with a cutting edge framework to build APIs capable of running on any data source or existing technology within the enterprise.
                            SOAJS is a data model free framework with a crucial feature that allows it to wrap any existing layer of technology and avoid re engineering the entire infrastructure.

                            SOAJS offers total flexibility to integrate any data source chosen by the Organization. While providing extreme flexibility with regards to applying business logic, it offers a  headache free environment for implementing fundamental back end or basic layers including security (key, oAuth, device, geo location, ACL,) multi tenancy, scalability, maintainability and SOA.

                            The benefit to deploying our architecture is that any enterprise will experience a  60% boost in its product development. This pillar can be completed by programming  the missing 40% API code specific to each individual company’s needs</p>
