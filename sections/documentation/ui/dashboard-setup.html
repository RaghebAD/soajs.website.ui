<h1>Dashboard Setup</h1>

<div class="white-container">
	<p>
		The dashboard is divided into 2 parts, Service and GUI. In this section we will install both, run the services and servers needed, add an entry in our hosts file and access the GUI.
	</p>

	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>
		SOAJS requires that your machine has the following technologies installed and running so that you can download it and start using it:<br />
		- <a href="http://www.mongodb.org" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> ( version 2.6.7 or higher)<br>
		- <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> (version 0.10.25 or higher)<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		First you need to install all the needed modules of SOAJS and their dependencies as mentioned in <a href="#/getStarted">Get Started</a> Section under How to Install SOAJS.<br />
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/packages/soajs.controller" target="_blank">soajs.controller</a>
				<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install soajs.controller</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li style="display:none"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/packages/soajs.agent" target="_blank">soajs.agent</a>
				<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install soajs.agent</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/packages/soajs.oauth" target="_blank">soajs.oauth</a>
				<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install soajs.oauth</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/packages/soajs.urac" target="_blank">soajs.urac</a>
				<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install soajs.urac</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/packages/soajs.mongodb.data" target="_blank">soajs.mongodb.data</a>
				<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install soajs.mongodb.data</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/packages/soajs.dashboard" target="_blank">soajs.dashboard</a>
				<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install soajs.dashboard</code></pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
		Once all the modules are installed, run their services:<br />
		<pre><code class="bash">$ cd soajs.controller
$ node .
$ cd ../soajs.oauth
$ node .
$ cd ../soajs.urac
$ node .
$ cd ../soajs.dashboard/service
$ node .</code></pre>
		Make sure that you have <a href="http://nginx.org" target="_blank">nginx</a> installed and configured from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/packages/utilities" target="_blank">soajs.utilities</a>.<br /> Basically nginx configuration for SOAJS creates 2 virtual hosts the first being and address for the controller referred to as 127.0.0.1 and the second being and address to open the dashboard referred to as dashboard.soajs.org.<br /><br />
		If you are not familiar with Nginx configuration or require more details on how to install all the above services and the dependent technologies mentioned at the top, please refer to the <a href="#/documentation/deployment/all-in-one">Deployment/All In One</a> documentation page, and read how we explain in depth each step to get SOAJS running on one machine.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<h3>Import Test Data</h3>

	<p>
		Now that all the needed modules are installed, nginx is configured, import the sample data to the database.
		Navigate to <b>soajs.mongodb.data/modules/dashboard-ui</b> in your Terminal, and you will find a mongo script that imports some test data for you to start with.<br/>
		<pre><code class="bash"># make sure import.sh is executable
$ chmod +x import.sh

# execute import.sh
$ ./import.sh</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The script will import some test data so that you can login to the dashboard and start using it.<br />
		The imported data creates the following configuration:
		<ul>
			<li>One product that contains one package which grants access to the services needed to run the dashboard.</li>
			<li>One tenant that has one application which uses the above product package.</li>
			<li>One environment called "DEV" which is default to run your project in.</li>
			<li>One administrator group and one user to login to the dashboard</li>
		</ul>
		You can then login to the dashboard using username: <b>admin</b>, and password: <b>password</b>.<br />
		<u>Note:</u> <em>All imported records are locked and cannot be deleted since you need them to access the database as administrator.<br />You can always use the dashboard without importing the test data but that requires you create the product, environment, tenant, group and user account manually with the correct administrative priviledges. For reference checkout the sample records located in soajs.mongodb.data/modules/dashboard-ui.</em>
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<h3>Using the Dashboard UI</h3>
	<p>
		Since nginx has been configured, you can now open your browser and use the Dashboard UI by going to: <a href="http://dashboard.soajs.org" target="_blank">http://dashboard.soajs.org</a>.<br />
		Login using the test administrator account, this account has full privilege to all features, and create the environments, products, tenants and users you want.<br />
		The dashboard UI is configured to work with the dashboard service by providing the test tenant key that has access to all services. You can modify the value of this key after you create some real tenants. Simple navigate to <b>soajs.dashboard/ui/config.js</b> and change the value of the key in that file.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<h3>Dashboard UI Snapshots</h3>

	<p>
		The Dashboard interface is built on <a href="http://www.angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>.<br/>
		Benefit from the easy of use that the dashboard UI offers to easily navigate and manage SOAJS topology and provisioned data.<br/>
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/dashboard-grid.png" id="dashboard-grid" class="image-border img-margin-t-b"/>
		<br/>
		Menus and Grids enable you navigate, browse, search and locate, sort and find the different sections and records to accomodate the change that is needed whether to modify environments, products, tenants, users and other sections.<br/><br/>
		Quick links to Add, Edit and Remove content and/or configuration provide GUI interfaces and forms that once submitted will interact with the dashboard service, URAC and other services APIs.
		<br/>
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/dashboard-form.png" id="dashboard-form" class="image-border img-margin-t-b"/><br/>
		Interactive notification messages keep you alerted of the status of every request made whether successful or failure and in case of failure, they provide a clarifying message of the error that occured.
