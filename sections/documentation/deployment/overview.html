<h1>Deployment Overview</h1>
<div class="white-container">
	<p>
		SOAJS means to Service Oriented Architecture JavaScript. The framework is built on top of NodeJs, its data layer is built on top of MongoDB, HAproxy is there to create awareness among services and finally Nginx is used as the entry layer.<br/>
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/deployment-overview.png"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		SOAJS requires the following 3rd party technologies to be installed on the machine:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> ( version 2.6.7 or higher)</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.nodejs.org" target="_blank">NodeJs</a> (version 0.10.25 or higher)</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.nginx.com" target="_blank">Nginx</a> ( version 1.6.2 or higher )</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.haproxy.org" target="_blank">HAproxy</a> ( version 1.5.9 or higher )</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>SOAJS Packages</h3>
	<p>
		SOAJS comes with the following packages:

	<h4>Basic Service</h4>
	<p>
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/basic_service.png" class="image-right"/>
		Building a basic SOAJS service requires only two of the above mentioned packages: <a href="#/documentation">Framework</a> and <a href="#/documentation/services/controller">Controller</a>.<br />
		You need the framework to build your service and you need the controller so it can forward the requests to your service. This scenario is explained in depth in <a href="#/getStarted">Get Started</a> / <a href="#/getStarted/example01">Example 01</a>.<br />
		When the request reaches your service, SOAJS framework captures the request first, executes the needed features based on how you configured soajs framework for this service and throws an error or hands over the request to your service business logic.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h4>Basic Service with oAuth</h4>
	<p>
		This is exactly like the previous basic service example but with oauth turned on.<br />
		This scenario is explained in depth in <a href="#/getStarted">Get Started</a> / <a href="#/getStarted/example02">Example 02</a> and <a href="#/getStarted/example04">Example 04</a>. If you attempt to directly hit the api of either Example 02 or Example04 without providing an access_token, the request will be rejected. You will need to request a token from the oauth service first, and provide it in the consecutive requests to Example 02 and 04 services.
		<br />
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/secured_service.png"/><br />
		To configure your service to be protected by oauth, set the property oauth to true.<br />

	<h3>Data Layer</h3>
	<p>
		The data layer of soajs framework is built on top of MongoDB and uses two databases: CORE_PROVISION & CORE_SESSION
	</p>
	<h4>CORE_PROVISION</h4>
	<img ng-src="images/documentation/core_provision.png" class="image-right" />
	<table class="myTable">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Collection Name</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td width="20%"><b>environments</b></td>
				<td>List of environments and their IP addresses matching registry configuration.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="even">
				<td width="20%"><b>tenants</b></td>
				<td>List of available tenants and their applications and keys information.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td width="20%"><b>products</b></td>
				<td>List of available products and their packages along with the ACL permissions.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="even">
				<td width="20%"><b>oauth_users</b></td>
				<td>List of oAuth user accounts related to tenants.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td width="20%"><b>oauth_tokens</b></td>
				<td>List of tokens related to oAuth users accounts.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<br/><br/>
	<h4>CORE_SESSION</h4>
	<img ng-src="images/documentation/core_session.png" class="image-right" />
	<table class="myTable">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Collection Name</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td width="20%"><b>sessions</b></td>
				<td>List of sessions with full details on requests made by tenants, containing cookies, session information, api requested, key provided, passed parameters ...</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<h3>Service Scenario</h3>
	<p>
		When a request arrives to your service, it goes through the framework first then your business logic then it goes back to the framework before returning. The first entry to the framework, adds SOAJS alters the data as configured by the constructor parameters and adds the tools that SOAJS offers, SOAJS also talk to the data layer to check the key provided and the permissions and load the <a href="#/documentation/core/provisioning">provisioned</a> data based on the current running environment as configured in the <a href="#/documentation/core/registry">registry</a>. The second time the framework is used which is before returning the response, soajs formulates a unified and valid REST response before returning this response.<br />

	<br/>

	<h3>SOAJS Services and their appropriate Data Layer</h3>
	<p>
		We used SOAJS framework and created services that we call the SOAJS core services. Let us go over each one of them and explain their approriate data layer.
	</p>

	<h4>Controller Service</h4>
	<p>
		The controller is the gateway to soajs services. It receives the request, runs some validation steps and forwards the request to your service. The controller does not require any data layer.
	</p>
	<br/><br/>
	<h4>oAuth Service</h4>
	<p>
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/oauth_service.png" class="image-right"/><br />
		The oauth services, reads the tenant oauth secret and the user information from tenants and oauth_users collections in core_provision database and if the verification is valid, it inserts/update the user token in oauth_tokens collection.
	</p>
	<br/><br/>
	<h4>Urac Service</h4>
	<p>
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/urac_service.png" class="image-right"/><br />
		The urac services, reads the tenant information to determine if the provided key exists and has can access the service. Now that it knows the name of the tenant that the given key belongs to, all consequent requests are inserted/updated in a new database named after the tenant: TENANTNAME_URAC.
	</p>
	<br/><br/>
	<h4>Dashboard Service</h4>
	<p>
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/dashboard_service.png" class="image-right"/><br />
		The dashboard services, manages the information inside CORE_PROVISION collections. This service is responsilbe for creating environment, products, tenants and oauth users records.
	</p>
	<br/><br/>
	<h4>Examples Service</h4>
	<p>
		The examples services contains 3 services: Example02, 03, 04 that communicate with the data layer. This package is a guideline to how your services might be constructed. Example 01 does not communicate with the database, it simply manipulates the arriving input and sends it back in the response. Example 02 and 04 are protected by oAuth security and Example 02, 03, 04 provide tenant keys in the request. The following diagram illustrates how these examples work.<br />
		<img ng-src="images/documentation/examples_service.png" /><br /><br />
		The diagram above shows 4 different combinations of how a service can be constructed to work with soajs packages and the data layer.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="color:red;">Controller</span> communicates with both CORE_PROVISION & CORE_SESSION</li>
		<li><span style="color:orange;">oAuth</span> communicates with CORE_PROVISION</li>
		<li><span style="color:mediumpurple;">URAC</span> communicates with CORE_PROVISION & TENANTNAME_URAC</li>
		<li><span style="color:dodgerblue;">Example 03 & 04</span> have their own custom database (just like your service will be)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This architecture can be set up on either a single machine ( All in One ) or on a cloud and will behave and run the same way regardless of the hardware used, the only difference is that cloud architecture requires more servers and more configuration to set it up than simply installing it all on the one machine.
