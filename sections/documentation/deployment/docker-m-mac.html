<h1>Docker Machine Deployment on Mac</h1>
<div class="white-container">
	<p>
		This page helps you install SOAJS using docker machine and offer you the benefit of deploying your cloud of services using containers.<br />
		This Mode creates 2 environments (Dashboard &amp; Dev) that isolates containers depending on the environment they are deployed in.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>
		SOAJS is built using NodeJs and MongoDB therefore, you need to have them installed and running on your machine.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="bash"># Install Xcode command-line tools, this is recommended for brew
$ xcode-select --install

# Install Brew
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade
$ brew services

# Install NodeJS, Docker, Docker-machine and MongoDB
$ brew install homebrew/versions/node012 docker docker-machine mongodb

# turn off mongo since we only need its tools in the remaining steps
$ brew services stop mongodb</code></pre>
	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>
		Now install <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npmjs.org/packages/soajs.utilities">soajs.utilities</a> via NPM in /opt/soajs to acquire the configuration files needed to deploy SOAJS.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="bash"># soajs modules go here
$ mkdir -p /opt/soajs/node_modules/ && cd /opt/soajs/

# install soajs.utilities
$ npm install soajs.utilities

# move the utilities to /opt/soajs/
$ mv /opt/soajs/node_modules/soajs.utilities ../

#Navigate to soajs.utilities and run the installation script
$ cd soajs.utilities/lib/

#execute the installer script
$ ./dockermachineDeploy.sh</code></pre>
	<em>The above command will install SOAJS framework and all the SOAJS core services from NPM then start all these services.</em>
	<p>
		Once you run the above script, choose <b>option 1</b> which refers to new installation.<br />
		During the installation, the script will ask you to enter a domain for your application.
	</p>
	<h3>Configuration</h3>
	<p>
		Update the hosts file on your machine and point out the following domains:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="bash">$ gedit /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   dashboard-api.soajs.org
127.0.0.1   dashboard.soajs.org
127.0.0.1   api.mydomain.com</code></pre>
	<p>
		Once the Installation script finishes, it will output the above two lines with the correct IP address.<br/>
		Make sure you put the correct IP address instead of 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/hosts file.<br />
		The <b>api.mydomain.com</b> will actually contain the value of the domain you entered during installation.
	</p>
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>
		The domain dashboard-api.soajs.org redirects requests to the dashboard services which allows you to manage the provisioned information in core database.
	</p>
	<p>
		In your browser, go to <a target="_blank" href="http://dashboard.soajs.org">http://dashboard.soajs.org</a> and login using the administrator account. This account was created when you ran the installation script. A sample data was also imported by the script and provides the following accounts:
	</p>
	<b>Owner:</b> ( Full access to all Dashboard services )
	<ul>
		<li><b>Username:</b>&nbsp; owner</li>
		<li><b>Password:</b>&nbsp; password</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<b>Client:</b> ( Limited access to Dashboard services )
	<ul>
		<li><b>Username:</b>&nbsp; client</li>
		<li><b>Password:</b>&nbsp; password</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Once you login, you can modify these credentials, monitor the services and perform all core operations related to <a href="#/documentation/advanced/multitenancy">Multitenancy</a>, <a href="#/documentation/advanced/productization">Productization</a>, <a href="#/documentation/advanced/environment">Multi Environment</a> and other. Checkout the <a href="#/documentation/ui/dashboard">Dashboard</a> to see what features are offered.
