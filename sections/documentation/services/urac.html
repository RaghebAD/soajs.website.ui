				SOAJS User Registration & Access Control is a service that Manages the Users records and their Access Controls.<br/>
				The service is Multitenant and provides the:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ability for administrators to control user accounts, groups and access levels.</li>
				<li>ability to update profile and preferences for logged in members.</li>
				<li>ability to register and login for anonymous users.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>User Record</h3>
			<p>
				The URAC offers the ability to override the default access levels as well as tenant configuration for specific users. Access Levels are provided by product packages and tenant applications. Detail explanation about Access levels and how they can be overriden is explained in <a href="#/documentation/core/acl">Access Levels</a> section under ocumentation.

				Every User Record contains his account credentials, the group list he is member of, a profile information object, the status of his account and a configuration object that is used to override the default ACL permissions. The following is a sample of how a user record looks like:
			</p>
			<div ng-init="loadCode(path + 'services/urac/userRecord.js', 'user-record-sample');"></div>
			<div id="user-record-sample"></div>
			<em>The following snippet represents a user record in the database.</em>
			<br/>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Group Record</h3>
			<p>
				A group represents a list of users and is mainly used by the Access Level. Users can be part of multiple groups and a group can contain multiple users accounts. Groups are used by the ACL as shown in the <a href="#/documentation/core/acl">Access Levels</a> section under documentation when granting access to a service or a specific API in a service. A service can be public and accessible by everyone, private and require logged users or accessible by members of particular groups and in that case, the groups names are linked to the Urac Group section. The following is a sample of how a group record looks like:
			</p>
			<div ng-init="loadCode(path + 'services/urac/groupRecord.js', 'group-record-sample');"></div>
			<div id="group-record-sample"></div>
