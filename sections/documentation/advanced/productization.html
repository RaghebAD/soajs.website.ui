<div class="white-container">
	<h3>Products</h3>
	<p>
		Productize and Package your services with different access controls, rules and configuration and offer them to different clients. When new tenants are created and if they require access to services that you already created, simply grant the new tenants access to the the products you created at an early stage, no need to rewrite the service or modify the code so that the new tenant can use it. The following table explains what the product properties are and their purpose:

				<th>Property Name</th>
				<th>Property Type</th>
				<th>Description</th>

	<h3>Packages</h3>
	<p>
		Products have packages and these packages contain the access levels applied to the services. When instructing a product to use a certain service, you need to create a package in that product and in that package's acl, specify the ACL configuration over the service you want. The following table explains what the packages are made of and the purpose of their properties:

	<table width="100%" class="myTable">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Property Name</th>
				<th>Property Type</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>CODE</td>
				<td>String</td>
				<td>Package Code, alphanumeric up to 5 characters and unique.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="even">
				<td>Name</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Description</td>
				<td>String</td>
				<td>Package Description for informative purposes</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="even">
				<td>_TTL</td>
				<td>Timestamp</td>
				<td>Package Caching time limit. Once limit is exceeded, the package is refreshed.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>acl</td>

				<td>Package Access Level Object, contains permissions over services as explained in <a href="#/documentation/core/acl">Access Levels</a> section.</td>

	<p>
		Package the service with different permissions and access controls as we explained in <a href="#/documentation/core/acl">Access Levels</a> section and offer it as commercial products. Every product contains a list of packages where the default access level of our service APIs are defined. Each Package offers a variety of access levels on the service APIs. If a service is contained in a package, then this product offers the ability to use this service. When specifying the access level over a service, you can grant access to the whole service or add some restrictions.

	<h3>Code Sample</h3>

		<div id="productizationjs"></div>
	</div>
	<p>
		The above code snippet illustrates one product record named <b>Product One</b> and this product has 3 packages.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Package 1</b> has "urac" in its ACL property only, and that means it offers access to that service only.</li>
		<li><b>Package 2</b> has 2 services in its ACL and therefore, using this package means both these services are available.</li>
		<li><b>Package 3</b> is a bit more complex in how its ACL is built. It offers the access to the "urac" service and only one API from the "example03" service. Section <a href="#/documentation/core/acl">Access Levels</a> explains how to configure the ACL in depth.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		This product is stored in the database after it is created, and it is used by different tenants to grant them access to services written using SOAJS. Product records are located in <b>products</b> collection under <b>core_provision</b> database.
