<h1>SOAJS Request</h1>
<hr/>
<div>
	<p>
		When you build your service, <b>SOAJS</b> adds its functionality and properties to the request and response of that service. These features empower the developer to have all the tools needed to develop the API quickly and offer common ground between team members.<br/>
	</p>
	Here is a list of what <b>SOAJS</b> adds to the request object:
	<h3><b><u>Req++</u></b></h3>

	<table width="100%" class="myTable">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Property</th>
				<th>Purpose</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr ng-repeat="feature in request" ng-class="{'first': $first, 'last': $last}" ng-class-odd="'odd'" ng-class-even="'even'">
				<td><b>{{feature.property}}</b></td>
				<td>{{feature.purpose}}</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
